To connect to a Linux server with root access using SSH from a local Windows machine via Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Remote - SSH extension in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for "Remote - SSH". Install the extension developed by Microsoft.

2. Open a new instance of Visual Studio Code.

3. Click on the Remote Explorer icon on the left-hand side of the activity bar (the sidebar on the left).

4. In the Remote Explorer, click on the "SSH Targets" button at the top. Then, click on the "Add SSH Host" option.

5. A text box will appear at the top of the editor. Enter the username and IP address of your Linux server in the following format:  `root@157.245.220.115` .

6. Visual Studio Code will prompt you to enter the SSH password. Enter the password  `1senhaBasica`  for the root user.

7. Once the connection is established, you will see your Linux server listed in the Remote Explorer.

8. Click on the server entry to connect to it. Visual Studio Code will open a new window with a remote connection to your Linux server.

That's it! You should now be connected to your Linux server as the root user using SSH in Visual Studio Code.
